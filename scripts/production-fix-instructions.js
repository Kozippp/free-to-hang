üîß PRODUCTION-READY RLS FIX FOR FRIEND REQUESTS

Copy and paste this SQL into Supabase SQL Editor:
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nfzbvuyntzgszqdlsusl/sql/new

=== PRODUCTION SQL (COPY EVERYTHING BELOW) ===

-- Production-Ready RLS Policies for Friend Requests
-- This maintains security while allowing proper service role operations

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own friend requests" ON friend_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create friend requests" ON friend_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own friend requests" ON friend_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own friend requests" ON friend_requests;

-- Policy for SELECT operations
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own friend requests" ON friend_requests
  FOR SELECT USING (
    (auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND (auth.uid() = sender_id OR auth.uid() = receiver_id))
    OR
    auth.role() = 'service_role'
  );

-- Policy for INSERT operations
CREATE POLICY "Users can create friend requests" ON friend_requests
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    (auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND auth.uid() = sender_id)
    OR
    auth.role() = 'service_role'
  );

-- Policy for UPDATE operations
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own friend requests" ON friend_requests
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    (auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND (auth.uid() = receiver_id OR auth.uid() = sender_id))
    OR
    auth.role() = 'service_role'
  );

-- Policy for DELETE operations
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own friend requests" ON friend_requests
  FOR DELETE USING (
    (auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND (auth.uid() = receiver_id OR auth.uid() = sender_id))
    OR
    auth.role() = 'service_role'
  );

üîí SECURITY EXPLANATION:
- Authenticated users can only access their own friend requests
- Service role (your Express backend) can access all requests for API operations
- This maintains proper security while enabling backend functionality
- No temporary workarounds - this is production-ready

üìù STEPS:
1. Go to the Supabase SQL Editor link above
2. Paste the SQL code
3. Click "Run"
4. Test friend requests in your app

üéØ This solution:
‚úÖ Maintains security (users can only see their own data)
‚úÖ Allows backend operations (service role access)
‚úÖ Is production-ready (no temporary hacks)
‚úÖ Follows Supabase best practices
